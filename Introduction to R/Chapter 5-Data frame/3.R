# Have a look at the structure
# Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function str(). The function str() shows you the structure of your data set. For a data frame it tells you:
#   
#   The total number of observations (e.g. 32 car types)
# The total number of variables (e.g. 11 car features)
# A full list of the variables names (e.g. mpg, cyl ... )
# The data type of each variable (e.g. num)
# The first observations
# Applying the str() function will often be the first thing that you do when receiving a new data set or data frame. It is a great way to get more insight in your data set before diving into the real analysis.
