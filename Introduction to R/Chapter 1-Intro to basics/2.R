# Arithmetic with R
# In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:
#   
#   Addition: +
#   Subtraction: -
#   Multiplication: *
#   Division: /
#   Exponentiation: ^
#   Modulo: %%
#   The last two might need some explaining:
#   
#   The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
# The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.
# With this knowledge, follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.
