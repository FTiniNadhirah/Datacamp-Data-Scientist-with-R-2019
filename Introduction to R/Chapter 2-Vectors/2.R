# Create a vector (2)
# Let us focus first!
#   
#   On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.
# 
# In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:
#   
#   numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
# character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
# Once you have created these vectors in R, you can use them to do calculations.

numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

boolean_vector <-c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
