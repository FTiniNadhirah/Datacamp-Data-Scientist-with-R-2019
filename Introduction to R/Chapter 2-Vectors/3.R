# Create a vector (3)
# After one week in Las Vegas and still zero Ferraris in your garage, you decide that it is time to start using your data analytical superpowers.
# 
# Before doing a first analysis, you decide to first collect all the winnings and losses for the last week:
#   
#   For poker_vector:
#   
#   On Monday you won $140
# Tuesday you lost $50
# Wednesday you won $20
# Thursday you lost $120
# Friday you won $240
# For roulette_vector:
#   
#   On Monday you lost $24
# Tuesday you lost $50
# Wednesday you won $100
# Thursday you lost $350
# Friday you won $10
# You only played poker and roulette, since there was a delegation of mediums that occupied the craps tables. To be able to use this data in R, you decide to create the variables poker_vector and roulette_vector.

# Assign the winnings/losses for roulette to the variable roulette_vector.

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
